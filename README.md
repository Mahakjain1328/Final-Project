âœ… Project Summary: Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction

ðŸ“Œ Objective: To build a predictive model that identifies patients at risk of missing healthcare appointments and to provide actionable insights for improving scheduling efficiency and resource allocation.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
Python:

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas for data preprocessing and model development

Power BI: Used for interactive data visualization and trend analysis

ðŸ§ª Methodology & Key Insights
1. Data Preparation: Imported and cleaned real-world healthcare appointment data.

Engineered relevant features including:

Gender

Age groups

Treatment types

Day of the week

SMS reminder status

2. Model Development
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the likelihood of a patient attending or missing an appointment.

Identified key predictors:

Age group

SMS reminder

Day of the week

3. Dashboard Analysis (Power BI)
Age Insight: The 60+ age group had the highest no-show rate.

Weekday Trends: Thursday and Friday recorded the most missed appointments.

SMS Effectiveness: Patients who received SMS reminders showed a 75% attendance rate.

Other Factors: Gender and treatment type showed minimal correlation with appointment attendance.

ðŸ“¦ Final Deliverables
Component	Description
Prediction Model	Decision Tree classifier for predicting appointment attendance
Power BI Dashboard	Visual analytics highlighting trends by age, reminders, and weekdays
Optimization Recommendations	

Prioritize SMS reminders, especially for the 60+ age group

Consider reducing appointments on Thursdays and Fridays
